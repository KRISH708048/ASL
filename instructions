TIP:-> Use virtualenv library for that

Activate the library and follow the steps:
1-> USE command below to install all libraries
    pip install -r requirements.txt 

2-> Things you have to add are only in cam_stream/views.py i have commented everything what you have to do 

3-> Ensure to get full details of the model before designing your preprocessing function for model input frames

4-> In order to test your code on webpage (running django server) enterr following command :
    python manage.py runserver
