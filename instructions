I advice you all to create a virtual environment at first before installing the libraries

TIP:-> Use virtualenv library for that

Activate the library and follow the steps:
1-> USE command below to install all libraries
    pip install -r requirements.txt 

2-> In order to test your code on webpage:
    python manage.py runserver
